<h2>1. Social sentiment analysis</h2>
<p><Strong>Abstract</Strong></p>
<p> Sentiment analysis is a fast growing topic with various world applications, from polls to advertisement placement. Traditionally individuals gather feedback from their friends or relatives before purchasing an item, but today the trend is to identify the opinions of a variety of individuals around the globe using micro blogging data. Using this information real time graphs are plotted.</p>

<p>In this project, we are going to build a real time twitter sentiment system. This system captures twitter data analyses tweets to categorize them to positive/negative or neutral. We are going to use machine learning technique to train our system to understand different kind of tweets.

<h2>2. Github based Recruitment system</h2>
<p><Strong>Abstract</Strong></p>
<p> Github is the new CV. More and more people get recruited by their open source contribution. No more static CV is enough. Recruiters want to know how proficient given candidate in a given technology. Github gives excellent data to analyze this.</p>

<p> But with existing tools, it's very difficult to analyze the github data to get potential candidates for given job. So it will be nice to have a tool which can analyze github data to come up with list of potential candidates for a given job.</p>

<p>This project aim to build a system which analyzes github data to help recruiters. Recruiters can use this tool to search specific candidates with required skill set. This system ranks the candidates based on their level of contribution. It also organizes candidates based on location, which further helps recruiters to filter their candidates.

<h2>3. Read it later service on MEAN stack</h2>
<p><Strong>Abstract</Strong></p>
<p> In a multi device world, being in sync is important. Read it later service allows user to save the links from web, phone to a centralized repository. These saved links can be view in multiple devices and also can be shared with friends.</p>

<p> In this project,we are going to build a read it later service using MEAN stack. MEAN stack is JavaScript based framework for rapid web application development.

<h2>4. Movie recommendation engine</h2>
<p><Strong>Abstract</Strong></p>
<p> Recommendations is what everyone generally does now a days. We come across the recommendations in every e commerce site we visit,in every social networking site we browse. In this Movie recommendation engine we recommend the movies for user based on his facebook profile.</p>

<p> This project aims at building a recommendation engine for old english movies. The system makes use of the user's facebook profile to capture users movie interests, which in turn used in the engine for giving out the recommendation. We will train huge amount of open source movie data in this project to build a recommendation model.

<h2>5. Functional distributed system on Apache Mesos</h2>
<p><Strong>Abstract</Strong></p>
<p> Functional programming is the central theme of most of the distributed system these days. Functional programming helps a given task to be divided and run independent of each. This level abstraction allows us to parallelize these operation to run on distributed systems.</p>

<p>In this project, we are going to build a functional oriented distributed system in Scala on distributed system framework Apache mesos. Mesos is distributed framework which allows to build distributed systems from scratch rapidly.
